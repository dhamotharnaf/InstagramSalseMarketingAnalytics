You can follow the below mentioned regime:-

""AM : Niacinamide
 ​PM : Niacinamide > Retinol 0.3% + Q10
 PM : Lactic Acid
 PM : Niacinamide
 
 
  Please note the below points before you start following this routine : 
 *Do a patch test before using the product(s) also note that the multiple PM routines shared above are to be used on separate nights, please do not overlap these routines
 *Use  Retinol 0.3% + Q10 twice a week & gradually increase the frequency
 *Use Lactic Acid twice a week & increase frequency to every alternate night once your skin adjusts
 *Keep 3-5 mins gap while layering the products
 *Always wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30 or above during the day as your skin becomes more susceptible to sunburn
 *Apply all actives on dry skin & use only 2-3 drops of serum for application

Not to worry, we recommend you give a try to our Hyaluronic + VitaminB5 for dry skin, as it's a hydrating booster with a punch of Vitamin B5 that pulls moisture deep into the skin & locks in there, leaving instant plump, baby-soft skin. It goes well with all skin types including very sensitive skin too. 

Also, we suggest you add our skin barrier repair formulation cream to your routine
Go with Ceramides 0.3% + Bisabolol that strengthens skin Barrier, hydrates & soothes skin.
It is an everyday moisturizing cream with 5 Ceramides to restore & repair skin’s natural barrier & prevent water loss. An ultra-moisturizing cream suitable for dry/normal skin. 

However, you must do a patch test before.
Hope this works well for you :)","2021-12-28T06:14:52.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,"1","My skin type is dry and sensitive, nothing suits on my skin, skin is very flaky tried of using products nothing suits, skin is highly sensitive....","2021-12-27T13:17:59.000Z"

Here is the skincare routine you should follow: 

AM : Vitamin C

 

 Please note the below points before you start following this routine : 

 *Do a patch test before using the product

 *Always wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30 or above during the day as your skin becomes more susceptible to sunburn

 *Apply all actives on dry skin & use only 2-3 drops of serum for application

 *Below is the general layering practice one should follow while incorporating skincare actives in your routine

 

 AM : Cleanse > Tone > Skincare Actives > Moisturizer > Sunscreen (SPF30 or above)

 PM : Cleanse > Tone > Skincare Actives > Moisturizer

You are already using the right product

Alpha Arbutin 2% + Hyaluronic Acid 1% inhibits melanin production without affecting cell viability & will help in reducing acne marks, dark spots, pigmentation, and fixes uneven skin tone 

However, Vitamin C is a glow boosting daily serum that brightens & tones sun damaged & dull skin with dark spots & works well with all skin types 

You can surely try this :)","2021-06-19T04:26:32.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,"1","I have already using for alpha arbutin can I use vitamin c  serum also and I am pigmentation skin","2021-06-18T13:44:33.000Z"

Ultraviolet light emitted by the sun induces free radical formation in the skin and that leads to photoaging and even cancer. Vitamin C is a great antioxidant and it protects the skin against the harmful effects of UV radiation. So it’s not only safe to use Vitamin C during the day, it, in fact, is helpful to do that. However, please note that Vitamin C is not a replacement for your sunscreen and you should always layer your Vitamin C serum with a good sunscreen when using Vitamin C during the day.","2021-07-08T13:08:05.000Z","17866580957530309","0","riim_makeup_artist","@beminimalist__ please check dm","2021-07-09T17:17:01.000Z","18176850574186762","0","beminimalist__","@rimpa_mondal We have responded you back over DM kindly check","2021-07-11T09:08:48.000Z","3","Can I use vitamin c  in PM?","2021-07-07T19:51:16.000Z"

Ultraviolet light emitted by the sun induces free radical formation in the skin and that leads to photoaging and even cancer. Vitamin C is a great antioxidant and it protects the skin against the harmful effects of UV radiation. So it’s not only safe to use Vitamin C during the day, it, in fact, is helpful to do that. However, please note that Vitamin C is not a replacement for your sunscreen and you should always layer your Vitamin C serum with a good sunscreen when using Vitamin C during the day. 

However if you wish you can use it in PM as well. Here is the regime:-

""AM : Vitamin C > Niacinamide
 PM : Niacinamide
 
  Please note the below points before you start following this routine : 
 *Do a patch test before using the product
 *Keep 3-5 mins gap while layering the products
 *Always wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30 or above during the day as your skin becomes more susceptible to sunburn
 *Apply all actives on dry skin & use only 2-3 drops of serum for application
 *Below is the general layering practice one should follow while incorporating skincare actives in your routine
 
 AM : Cleanse > Tone > Skincare Actives > Moisturizer > Sunscreen (SPF30 or above)
 PM : Cleanse > Tone > Skincare Actives > Moisturizer""","2021-11-27T04:52:30.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,"1","Can I use both the serums one after the other at night before bed? If yes then which one to apply first and how much to apply ?","2021-11-26T17:05:39.000Z"

It is a mild exfoliator that also helps in clearing dead skin cells & reducing the pore size. 

For uneven skin tone, use Niacinamide 5%. Formulated with 5% concentration of pure Niacinamide that is lab tested to inhibit melanin synthesis to delivering even skin tone.

You made the right choice, Salicylic will work very well with acne, blackheads and Niacinamide is a multipurpose serum that helps overall

We suggest you to dont use serums on lips, you can use them around mouth and nose area

Here is the skincare routine you should follow: 

AM : Niacinamide

 PM : Salicylic Acid > Niacinamide

 PM: Niacinamide 

 

 Please note the below points before you start following this routine : 

 *Do a patch test before using the product(s) also note that the multiple PM routines shared above are to be used on separate nights, please do not overlap these routines

 *Use Salicylic Acid on alternate days & gradually increase the frequency to daily & if you have sensitive skin, use Salicylic Acid only 2-3 times a week

 *Keep 3-5 mins gap while layering the products

 *Always wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30 or above during the day as your skin becomes more susceptible to sunburn

 *Apply all actives on dry skin & use only 2-3 drops of serum for application

 *Below is the general layering practice one should follow while incorporating skincare actives in your routine

 

 AM : Cleanse > Tone > Skincare Actives > Moisturizer > Sunscreen (SPF30 or above)

 PM : Cleanse > Tone > Skincare Actives > Moisturizer","2021-06-08T10:32:46.000Z","17892479579157310","0","yashvijalan97","@beminimalist__ also what about the eye area? Under eye and lids? 
And supposedly i have used Niam in the AM and salicylic in the PM, i can apply Niam post 3/4 mins of Salicylic daily at PM also even when im not using Salycilic? 
Also can Niam be used daily? I’ll make sure to use Salicylic alternate days.","2021-06-08T10:38:02.000Z","17907780760918350","0","beminimalist__","@yashvijalan97 We suggest you to don't use serums too close to the eyes

Since you have sensitive skin, you can add our PHA 3% + Biotic Toner as an exfoliator which you can use every day or you can consult a dermatologist for laser treatments, etc.

AHA & PHA exfoliates while BHA clears congestion of pore, delivering incredible brightening & elastic feel for the baby-soft complexion. It provides multi-level exfoliation, both on the surface & inside the pores, giving you a healthy, plump, and glowing skin. 

However, Use 2% salicylic acid as it wards off comedones(blackheads and whiteheads) and keeps your oils in check for that flawless matt look everyone dreams of. It is an exfoliant that sheds off dead skin cells by penetrating deep into the pore lining and inhibiting sebum production.","2021-08-07T05:53:39.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,"1","Would it be helpful for closed comedones??","2021-08-06T16:23:51.000Z"
